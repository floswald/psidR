Title: Build panel data sets from PSID raw data

Description: Makes it easy to build panel data in wide format from PSID
    delivered raw data. Deals with data downloaded and pre-processed by stata or SAS,
    or can optionally download directly from the PSID server using the SAScii package.
    psidR takes care of merging data from each wave onto a cross-period index file,
    so that individuals can be followed over time. The user must specifiy which years
    they are interested in, and the PSID variable names (e.g. ER21003) for each year
    (they differ in each year). There are different panel data designs and two 
    popular subsetting criteria (heads only and core sample only) implemented.
